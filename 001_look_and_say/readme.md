# Look And Say

Let’s define a function lookAndSay as follow: read off the digits of the input, counting the number of digits in groups of same digit. Here are some examples of this function:

- `lookAndSay(1) = 11` — because 1 is read off as “one 1” or 11
- `lookAndSay(11) = 21` — because 11 is read off as “two 1s” or 21.
- `lookAndSay(111221) = 312211` — because 111221 is read off as “three 1s, two 2s and one 1” or 312211
When the define a **lookAndSay** sequence as repeatedly called the “Look and Say” function on its output. Given a number start and number of iteration n, calculate the nth number in a “Look and Say” sequence starting with start.

Reusing the previous example with start = 11 and n = 2, LookAndSay(11,2) would be the same as `lookAndSay(lookAndSay(11)) = 1211`.

Since this sequence grows quickly we will use a string representation for the number in sequence to avoid number overflow.
